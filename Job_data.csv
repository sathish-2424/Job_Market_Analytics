38 gemeenten, Openbaar Ministerie en politie van de regio Midden-Nederland hebben afgesproken de krachten effectief te bundelen. Hun doelen staan in de Veiligheidsstrategie 2023 – 2026 beschreven. Bureau Regionale Veiligheidsstrategie (RVS) faciliteert de veiligheidspartners bij het bereiken van deze doelen. Het is onze missie om onze partners te helpen excelleren. Het Regionaal informatie en expertisecentrum Midden-Nederland (RIEC MN) bundelt de krachten om de georganiseerde ondermijnende drugscriminaliteit een halt toe te roepen.

Help jij ons om cijfers en data over de regio Midden-Nederland inzichtelijk en bruikbaar te krijgen?

Cijfers, informatie en kennis helpen onze partners om keuzes te maken om onze maatschappij veilig te maken en houden. Hiervoor zoeken wij een nieuwe collega bij team Informatiewerk van Bureau RVS en het RIEC Midden-Nederland. De Veiligheidscoalitie MN maakt voor haar eigen informatiebehoefte en die van de regionale veiligheidspartners gebruik van online gegevensdashboards. Deze worden in SWING en Tableau ontwikkeld, beheerd en onderhouden door het team informatiewerk. Als data analist voor het team Informatiewerk van het RIEC MN en Bureau RVS zorg jij voor het verwerken, ontsluiten, ordenen, analyseren en visualiseren van diverse databronnen. Ook weet je de resultaten van je werk begrijpelijk en overtuigend te presenteren en bruikbaar te maken voor diverse doelgroepen, zoals medewerkers van gemeenten en politie, en interne collega’s binnen bureau RVS en het RIEC. Je bent nieuwsgierig naar de mogelijkheden van nieuwe databronnen en ziet mogelijkheden deze binnen de wettelijke kaders te ontsluiten en te benutten. We doen de dataverwerking met tools die tot onze beschikking staan; onder andere SPSS, FME, R en ArcGis(let op geen Python). De verschillende databronnen worden veilig bewaard in een Oracle Database. Jij draagt bij aan het inrichten en onderhouden van deze database.

Zowel bureau RVS als het RIEC Midden-Nederland werken met veel partners samen. Jij vindt het leuk om te werken in een omgeving met verschillende organisaties met allemaal hun eigen informatieregimes en uitdagingen. Je vindt het belangrijk om te zorgen dat we op een rechtmatige manier de mogelijkheden van de AVG en het RIEC-convenant benutten.

Medewerkers uit de hele organisatie kunnen een beroep op je doen. Je vindt het leuk om met andere onderzoekers samen te werken, maar zelfstandig en alleen werken gaat je ook goed af. Je bent toegankelijk, pragmatisch, flexibel en analytisch en je bent in staat om je communicatief goed uit te drukken. Je deinst niet terug voor veel eigen verantwoordelijkheid en een veelheid aan onderwerpen en activiteiten. Belangrijk is dat jij denkt in kansen en mogelijkheden!

Taken en werkzaamheden

Je houdt je bezig met het onderhouden en (door)ontwikkelen van diverse online gegevensdashboards in SWING en Tableau, waar de Veiligheidscoalitie Midden-Nederland gebruik van maakt. Hierbij hoort het verkennen en gebruik maken van nieuwe mogelijkheden om onze partners laagdrempeliger inzicht te geven in verschillende databronnen (bijvoorbeeld door de onderdelen Mosaïc en Stories in SWING te gebruiken);
Je houdt je bezig met het (her)inrichten en het gebruik (beheer) van de Oracle Database;
Je stemt veelvuldig af met de andere twee kwantitatieve onderzoekers over de inhoud, opzet en planning van dataontsluiting;
Je bent eerste aanspreekpunt (en functioneel beheerder) voor partners over het gebruik van verschillende databronnen zoals het Tableau dashboard;
Je haalt feedback op van partners over het gebruik;
Je werkzaamheden zijn zowel van toegevoegde waarde voor het RIEC als voor Bureau RVS.

Wat wij vragen

Minimaal een afgeronde, relevante Hbo-opleiding en 4 jaar werkervaring in bijvoorbeeld een onderzoeks- of (data)analysefunctie;
Ruime ervaring met het ontsluiten van databronnen middels diverse tools en het verwerken van kwantitatieve onderzoeksgegevens. Je bent bekend met ETL-processen en SQL en tools als Excel, SPSS, FME, en Tableau;
Toegepaste kennis van SWING, Tableau Server, FME Server en Oracle is een pre;
Je werkt gestructureerd en planmatig. Werken onder tijdsdruk is geen probleem voor je;
Je bent zowel in staat om (intensief) samen als zelfstandig te werken. Als teamspeler draag je bij aan de binding en ontwikkeling van team informatiewerk;
Je beschikt over bestuurlijke sensitiviteit en geduld voor bestuurlijke (besluitvormings)processen;
Inzicht in het werkveld en de werkprocessen van gemeenten, politie, het Openbaar Ministerie en de Belastingdienst is een pre;
Kennis van de thema’s en onderwerpen uit de Veiligheidsstrategie is een pre;
Je spreekt en schrijft vloeiend Nederlands.

Wie wij zijn

De Veiligheidscoalitie Midden-Nederland richt zich op de aanpak van onveiligheid in dorpen en steden door effectief de krachten te bundelen. Bureau RVS en RIEC MN maken onderdeel uit van de Veiligheidscoalitie Midden-Nederland, waar ook de 38 gemeenten, politie, OM, en de 3 regionale Zorg- en Veiligheidshuizen toe behoren. Je basiswerkplek is in Utrecht centrum, in combinatie met thuiswerken. Kijk voor meer informatie op www.veiligheidscoalitie.nl.

Midden-Nederland is ambitieus in haar wens om de drugshandel en andere ondermijnende criminaliteit in haar gebied effectief te verstoren.

Dit kunnen we niet alleen met elkaar en met ondernemers en inwoners werken we samen om ons doel te bereiken.

Team informatiewerk ondersteunt de werkzaamheden van beide bureaus. Een team dat volop in ontwikkeling is en waar de teamleden vanuit verschillende achtergronden en kennis samenwerken om zinvolle informatieproducten en -ondersteuning te bieden aan onze partners.

Our goal is to contribute to zero emission mobility and allow EV drivers to charge at the right place with the right speed. The EV market is emerging and changing rapidly. With our proven track record and long experience, we keep driving forward with confidence.

A Bit More About The Job

We are looking for a new team member to join our Network Planning team, which is located in Berlin (DE). The Network Planning team is responsible for determining the right location for the right type of charger to support investment decisions for infrastructure expansion and to reach our goal of clean mobility. In other words: as a Data Analyst you spot locations where people with EVs are, or potentially would like to charge, based on lots of data. You do this through the evaluation of potential charging locations based on spatial, demographical and strategic factors and convert this into a business case. With your analyses you play a pivot role in the investment decisions for expansion of our network.

Of course you won’t do this alone. You will be a part of a dynamic international team. They will help you to get up to speed within Allego, but hopefully you can teach them a thing or two yourself, because a fresh pair of eyes always sees new things. The Network Planning team collaborates closely with related departments within Allego like Sales, Finance and Product Development. So you will operate in an international environment with colleagues from all over Europe.

Since Allego is one of the main players in this new and growing industry, you will be able to shape the future of transport and build the charging infrastructure of the future!

Requirements

This is you

With your excellent analytical skills, you recognize patters in big loads of data, so you can pinpoint ideal locations for EV chargers. You enjoy working with numbers and are always looking for ways to use data to improve results. Your flexibility, optimism and “can-do” attitude fits our fast-paced environment. You are eager to learn, highly self-motivated, and excited to work in the highly innovative and international sector of sustainable mobility!

As our ideal candidate:

You have at least 2 years experience in an analytics and/or e-mobility related position.
You combine your experience in data analysis with at least basic experience in geodata processing and/or business case modeling.

You have affinity towards the EV and charging industry.
You are able to independently manage multiple projects simultaneously.
Your excellent communication skills enable you to connect and collaborate with multiple internal stakeholders.
You are fluent in English, and as we will expand our network to many European countries, you are not afraid of fellow-Europeans.
You are located near Berlin AND you are eligible to work in a European country.

This is our offer

Still with us and interested and curious what we offer? First and foremost, we give you: salary! Rent needs to be paid after all. Pension? Also covered.

3624352444,Business Data Analyst,Full-time,On-site,Paris,France,Lokad,Computer Software,Business Data Analyst,"We’re looking for the right candidate to join our Business Data Analyst team and become part of a fast-growing company that is on always on the look for people that will demonstrate they’re able to grow with the company. As the role is our entry level, this is a great entry point for a career path at Lokad, either as a future technical expert or as manager.

We help companies in different verticals (aerospace, automotive, ecommerce…) to forecast and make decisions about their inventory. The vast majority of our clients are based outside of France, mainly in North America and Europe.

As a Business Data Analyst (or Supply Chain Scientist in Lokad's terminology), your role is to make sure our clients get the most from Lokad's technology. The role is a mix between technology, data crunching and supply chain expertise. You will address complex supply chain issues and craft quantitative strategies. Your goal is not only to advise your clients on strategies to adopt, but to craft and execute these strategies on a daily basis while leveraging the data available as much as possible. Your goal is also to keep refining these strategies over time to keep them aligned with the needs of our clients.

At Lokad, you will benefit from the extensive training and coaching of our expert team. You will gain skills in supply chain, predictive analysis and overall quantitative optimization for business. You will learn how to achieve measurable business results grounded on scientific analysis of data.

About one quarter of your time is spent interacting with clients in order to better understand their business (mainly over the phone or by mail, with occasional travels). Note that, in order to benefit from your colleagues expertise, you won't be required to work on the customers' premises.

The rest of your time is spent on data analysis, including manipulating and cleaning data, setting up forecasts, economic optimization, reporting and data vizualisation. In order to do this, you'll learn to use our Differentiable Programming tools and a DSL (Envision) developped by Lokad.

We are looking for candidates with the following skills and qualities:

A strong engineering background.
A keen interest in data and quantitative analysis in general.
Good Excel skills or programming skills (e.g. Python, VBA, SQL, etc.).
Impeccable command of English( French is optional).
Excellent communication skills and telephone manners.
A well-made head, rather than a well-filled head.We are not looking for someone who is already an expert in supply chain or programming. We’re looking for a fast learner, with an ability to quickly grasp technology and concepts, since our technology is by no means a simple and plug-and-play product. Knowledge or understanding of supply chain would be a bonus, but the ability to quickly assess and grasp a new situation or get a clear picture of how an organization works and what are the pain points is what we are really after.
Candidates must be self-motivated, confident and highly driven to achieve results with a “hands on” attitude.

The role is predominantly office based, although some travel will be occasionally required to customers, partners or events. We are located in the very center of Paris, France (station Chevaleret).","Data Analysis, English, Python (Programming Language), Communication, Analytical Skills, Supply Chain Optimization, Programming, Supply Chain Management, and Customer Service"

Diverse verlofregelingen (bijvoorbeeld 75% betaald ouderschapsverlof) en flexibele werktijden dragen bij aan een goede balans. En als dat niet genoeg is, dan is het ook nog mogelijk je werktijd (tijdelijk) enkele uren per week te verkorten en extra verlofuren en/of ADV-uren op te bouwen.

Naast een pensioenregeling bij het ABP ontvang je maandelijks een vergoeding woon-werkverkeer of kun je onder gunstige voorwaarden kiezen voor een OV-abonnement met onbeperkt reizen door heel Nederland.

De organisatie De Koninklijke Marechaussee

De Koninklijke Marechaussee (KMar) is een politieorganisatie met militaire status en wordt beheerd door de minister van Defensie. Ze is een van de vier krijgsmachtdelen van de Nederlandse krijgsmacht. Vanwege de specifieke taak valt de KMar, in tegenstelling tot de zee-, land- en luchtstrijdkrachten, niet onder direct bevel van de Commandant der Strijdkrachten. Behalve wanneer de KMar in het buitenland wordt ingezet voor andere taken dan de politietaak ten aanzien van militairen.

Het Commando Koninklijke Marechaussee (CKMar) voert politietaken uit op grond van de Politiewet (PW) 2012. De taken worden zowel nationaal als internationaal en tijdens missies uitgevoerd. Daarnaast levert het CKMar capaciteit aan de Commandant der Strijdkrachten voor deelname aan (militaire) missies, waarbij het CKMar andere taken uitvoert dan die in de PW zijn opgedragen.

De KMar waakt over de veiligheid van de Staat. In Nederland en ver daarbuiten. Ze wordt wereldwijd ingezet op plaatsen van strategisch belang. Van de koninklijke paleizen tot aan de buitengrenzen van Europa. Van luchthavens in Nederland tot oorlogs- en crisisgebieden overal ter wereld. De KMar is veelzijdig inzetbaar voor veiligheid, juist als het erop aankomt.

De afdeling Cluster Informatievoorziening

De werkzaamheden vinden plaats binnen het Cluster IV. De kern van het werken met informatie is om de Koninklijke Marechaussee dáár te brengen waar het eropaan komt, zodat we zo goed mogelijk het effect kunnen hebben dat van ons verwacht wordt: zorgen voor de veiligheid van de Staat. Informatie is daarvoor de basis. Een goed overzicht en inzicht van alle datadomeinen binnen Koninklijke Marechaussee is hiervoor cruciaal. Alle werkzaamheden ten aanzien van de functionaliteit en informatiebeheer van het systeemlandschap vinden plaats binnen het cluster. Daarbij adviseert het cluster over de inzet van datatechnologie en is toezichthouder op data-compliancy. Ook is de advisering, besturing en aansturing op gebied van informatiebeveiliging hier belegd.","Data Governance, Data Management, DAMA, Data Science, Data Engineering, Computer Science, Data Modeling, Analytical Skills, Operations Management, and Data Visualization"

DATA ANALIST – startersfunctie

Kom jij net van hogeschool of universiteit en heb je zin om in de praktijk echt met data aan de slag te gaan, dan hebben we voor jou de juiste functie! Bij Whooz helpen we in een team met specialisten elke dag onze klanten om met data antwoorden te geven op marketing- en locatievraagstukken.

Dus puzzel jij graag met veel data en creëer je graag waarde voor onze klanten door data om te zetten naar inzichten? Dan ben jij wellicht degene die we zoeken.

Wat we bieden is een mooie functie waarbij je data bewerkt en analyseert om vervolgens waardevolle inzichten te creëren voor onze klanten. Niet de data, de tool of de methodologie staat voorop, maar de toepassing van de klant! Stap voor stap begeleiden we jou op een informele manier, zodat je leert hoe jouw analytische skills waarde brengen aan de hand van concrete vraagstukken binnen klantanalyse, -werving en -behoud.

Al snel voer je in het team van analisten zelfstandig en in teamverband analyses uit voor onze opdrachtgevers. Daarnaast doe je dataleveringen aan licentieklanten en ondersteun je onze klanten in het vinden van waarde in data. Je bent nauwkeurig en analytisch en vindt het leuk om concreet aan de slag te zijn met data en klanten.

We snappen dat je wellicht nog niet 100% weet wat je wil voor de rest van de carrière en daarom is er binnen Whooz altijd ruimte om aan de hand van je interesse en/of nieuwe vragen uit de markt nieuwe technieken te proberen en nieuwe toepassingen te ontwikkelen. Bijvoorbeeld door een nieuwe manier en/of vorm te bedenken waarop we inzichten generen voor onze klanten of door mee te werken aan de ontwikkeling van een nieuw product.

Het allerbelangrijkste voor ons is dat je echt enthousiast wordt van data en analyses en dat je altijd nieuwsgierig bent naar nieuwe inzichten. Aangezien veel van onze klanten werken in het marketingveld is het fijn als je affiniteit hebt met (online) marketingtoepassingen. Vanzelfsprekend ben je veel met data in de weer, maar je schroomt niet om aan de klant je gevonden inzichten te presenteren, je advies toe te lichten en proactief met hem mee te denken.

Wat bieden we

Onze medewerkers vinden het fijn dat er een informele sfeer en open cultuur heerst binnen Whooz, waarbij we binnen het team samen de klant helpen en onze doelen behalen. Ook is er altijd ruimte voor eigen inzicht en ideeën. Ben je een beetje eigenwijs? Helemaal goed want dat zijn wij ook. We bieden een marktconform salaris en bieden je ruimte om je binnen je werk te ontwikkelen. De meeste dagen werken we met elkaar op ons ruime kantoor nabij het centrum van Den Haag, maar er is zeker ook ruimte en flexibiliteit om een deel van de dagen thuis te werken.

Functie-eisen

Naast dat iemand met HBO/WO werk- en denkniveau zoeken, vinden we het belangrijkste voor deze functie is, dat je iedere keer weer enthousiast wordt van data en analyses en de mogelijkheden die deze bieden voor organisaties. Vanzelfsprekend is het wenselijk dat je beschikt over analytische vaardigheden (statistiek, clustering, modellering, dashboarding) en datamanagement vaardigheden (dataprocessen inrichten en runnen). Kennis van het toepassen van technieken, zoals web scraping en artificiële intelligentie, voor het verzamelen en genereren van data is een pré. Je bent daarnaast servicegericht, professioneel, zelfbewust, communicatief vaardig en kunt zelfstandig, maar ook samen werken. Voor communicatie met onze klanten is een goede beheersing van de Nederlandse taal een must.

Ben jij de oplossingsgerichte dataliefhebber die wij zoeken? Neem dan contact met ons op. Je kunt je motivatie en CV sturen naar info@whooz.nl t.a.v. Peter.

3583294126,Data Analyst,Full-time,Hybrid,Brussels,Belgium,Belfius,Financial Services,Jobs | Data Analyst - Risk & ICM Data Delivery | Brussel,"Omschrijving

Bij Belfius geloven we dat data de basis vormen van onze digitale transformatie. Of het nu gaat om digitale marketing, het leveren van producten en diensten op maat, het nemen van tactische en strategische beslissingen, het verbeteren van de procedures of het monitoren van onze prestaties, data spelen in dat verband een cruciale rol.

Elke dag opnieuw vinden miljoenen verrichtingen plaats in de systemen van Belfius, wat telkens data oplevert. In het Risk/ICM Data Delivery-team moeten wij die gegevens begrijpen en ze vertalen in insights en tools ontwikkelen ter ondersteuning van de beslissingen en de strategie van de metiers.

De job in een notendop

Wij zijn op zoek naar iemand die ons kan ondersteunen in onze activiteiten inzake reporting en kwaliteitscontrole. In die functie hebt jij twee expertisedomeinen:

producten die provisieloon opleveren (rekeningen, fondsen, beleggingen enz.)
de kosten, en dat voor alle activiteiten van de bank

In die context krijg jij twee hoofdtaken toebedeeld. Aan de ene kant voer je analyses uit van de maandelijkse resultaten en zorg jij ervoor dat die de nodige kwaliteit hebben. Je stelt je analyses eveneens ter beschikking van de diverse stakeholders zodat zij hun beslissingen kunnen nemen. Aan de andere kant bekommer jij je eveneens om de follow-up van de evoluties in het domein (impact op de berekening van de rentabiliteit bij de lancering van nieuwe producten, het veranderen van tariefstructuur enz.) om de potentiële impact op onze activiteiten te analyseren.

Binnen de afdeling Data & Analytics maakt het Risk/ICM Data Delivery-team deel uit van Data Transformation Risk & ICM en is het verantwoordelijk voor het exploiteren van de data van het domein Risk & ICM voor het berekenen van de rentabiliteit en de positie van de risico’s van de klanten, segmenten, producten, metiers enz. Het team identificeert transversaal en gecentraliseerd de behoeften van de diverse betrokken partijen in termen van de visualisering en architectuur en is verantwoordelijk voor diverse taken:

ontwikkeling van cockpits: visualisering van het financieel/commercieel rendement en van de positie van Risk voor de segmenten/klanten/producten
verslagen opstellen en bestaande verslagen automatiseren: die worden opgesteld op basis van definities afkomstig uit geharmoniseerde gegevensbronnen
ad-hocanalyses: bijvoorbeeld op een categorie van klanten, een bepaald product enz

De afdeling omvat multifunctionele teams met o.m. data engineers en data analysts.

De Data Analyst is in de eerste plaats een aanspreekpunt in het domein van de kosten en de provisielonen en de aanwending van de gegevens daarrond.

De Data Analyst maakt deel uit van de Data Visualisation community en bepaalt en deelt in die hoedanigheid de best practices op het gebied van datavisualisatie.

Jij hoeft geen witte raaf te zijn

Al kan je er bij ons wel één worden. We zoeken vooral een straffe persoonlijkheid met een learning mindset.

Bij ons mag je volop je vleugels uitslaan als je iemand bent met:

een STEM diploma (Science, Technology, Engineer, Mathematichs), of een diploma in handels-/economische wetenschappen en/of relevante werkervaring

een gezonde dosis nieuwsgierigheid en een interesse in business en marketing concepten
sterke communicatievaardigheden

tweetaligheid (Nederlands/Frans) en kennis van het Engels
oog voor detail en datanuances
het vermogen om een massa aan gegevens samen te vatten en om te zetten in kerninzichten

Met 75 autonome hotels die allen eigen systemen en een eigen inrichting van deze systemen hebben liggen er genoeg data-uitdagingen om aan te pakken! Nu nog een klein team bestaande uit vijf collega’s, maar aan het einde van het jaar willen we groeien naar zeven collega’s.

De organisatie
Werken bij de toekan betekent werken bij het meest gastvrije hotels van Nederland. Een stralende glimlach op de gezichten van onze gasten, daar doen we het voor! Je komt te werken bij het Valk Service Center. Dit is de faciliterende organisatie voor meer dan 70 Van der Valk hotels in het binnen- en buitenland. In verschillende teams zoals marketing, revenue management en HR ondersteunen we samen onze hotels op de best mogelijke manier. Dit doen we op ons moderne kantoor in het mooie Van der Valk Hotel in Breukelen.
